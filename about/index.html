	<p>
	I am currently a first-year student at the University of Washington, hoping to get into a computing-related major.
  I	am also looking at pursuing a Germanics minor, but that is tentative for now. I play video games, enjoy playing soccer
	and watching sports in general. Thanks for stopping by!
