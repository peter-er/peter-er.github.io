	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
	<p>
	I am currently a first-year student at the University of Washington, hoping to get into a computing-related major. 
	I am also looking at pursuing a Germanics minor, but that is tentative for now. I play video games, enjoy playing soccer
	and watching sports in general.

	This site is primarily dedicated to my various Computer Science related projects I might be pursuing. I may post about other
	significant life events, but those happen rarely. It is pretty bare-bones right now, but I hope this site gets a little more
	interesting as time progresses. Thanks for stopping by!
