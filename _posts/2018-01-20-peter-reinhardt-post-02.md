title: "Dracula for jGrasp"

My first "project" of sorts was creating a theme for the IDE we use at UW. It isn't widely supported with themes so I thought I would make
one that other jGrasp users might want to use as well. Dracula is a dark theme that seems to be popular with many other IDEs and programs so
I thought it would be nice to add jGrasp to the mix. jGrasp uses a unique *.colors.xml filetype to set the color theme, so I had to download the standard
color settings, change the RGB values to the ones specified by the Dracula creator in Notepad++, and then just saving that file. Hardly worthy
of being called a project, but you've gotta start somewhere, right?
