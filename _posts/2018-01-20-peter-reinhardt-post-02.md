title: "Dracula for jGrasp"

My first "project" of sorts was creating a [theme](https://github.com/peter-er/jGrasp-dracula) for the IDE we use at UW, jGrasp. It isn't widely supported with themes so I thought I would make one that other jGrasp users might want to use as well. [Dracula](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme) is a dark theme that seems to be popular with many other IDEs and programs so I thought it would be nice to add jGrasp to the mix. jGrasp uses a unique .colors.xml filetype to set the color theme, so I had to download the standard color settings, change the RGB values to the ones specified by the Dracula official color palette, and then save that file. Hardly worthy of being called a project, but it was my first GitHub repo so I thought it was worth mentioning.
